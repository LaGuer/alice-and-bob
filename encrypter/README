A very simple encrypter, which uses GPG and a trivial algorithm to create
some files with random information, unique to each student on the class.
It should automate the tedious process of obtaining each student's unique
ID assigned by the university, and creating each encrypted file manually.
Inherently usable only by UFSC students.
