Implementation based on [1] for a subset of the Keccak sponge function family,
known as the FIPS 202 (SHA-3) standard. It serves primarily as a cryptographic
hash function with infinite output.

`shodan.out` is a step-by-step output for the message

    "How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?"

containing all the twenty-four rounds and its steps.

A video explaining Keccak, in pt_BR, was produced as part of the assignment.
It is unlisted by default, but it can be watched here [2].
